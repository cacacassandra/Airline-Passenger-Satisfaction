# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project explores factors influencing airline passenger satisfaction using machine learning and Spark-based big data tools.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Analyzed airline passenger survey data through four key tasks:

- **Linear Regression**: Predicted arrival delays based on flight features, evaluated with RMSE.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Classified satisfaction using Spark MLlib, evaluated with ROC AUC.
- **Random Forest**: Identified key features driving satisfaction, assessed with precision-recall metrics.
- **K-means Clustering**: Segmented passengers by satisfaction and delay tolerance, visualized with clustering tools.
